abstract = {Applied General Equilibrium (AGE) models are increasingly used for short-run commodity market analysis, although they are generally not designed for such purposes. This study remedies a key shortcoming of such work by incorporating a commodity stockholding model into a short-run global AGE model. An approach to calibrating and validating the model is demonstrated for the staple grains sector. Its historical weather-induced supply shocks form a natural vehicle for reconciling model outcomes with observed behavior. The stockholding model, in conjunction with a Gaussian Quadrature approach to characterizing supply-side uncertainty, will prove useful to researchers seeking to conduct short-run analysis of commodity market policy in an AGE context.}

abstract = {Abstract We study here the effects of a public subsidy to private storage set up at world level. To simulate the welfare effects and impacts on market fluctuations of this subsidy, we use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model assuming imperfect expectations. We also perform different statistical analysis based on our CGE results and show that the storage subsidy can have the undesired effect of destabilizing agricultural markets, depending on the form of economic agents’ price expectations and on the structure of the shocks impacting the agricultural production.},
