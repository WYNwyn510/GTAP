abstract: "The projected growth of the population and incomes as implied by various shared socioeconomic pathways is expected to create  pressures on converting forests into farmland as food prices increase. Depending on the specific path taken, SSP1 through SSP5, and the continuation of the current trends in agricultural productivity growth, the market impacts are expected to vary but generally resulting in increases in food prices. Policies aimed at reversing the deforestation trend by afforesting crop land would result in severe negative market impacts such as  higher food prices, especially in low agriculutrla productivity/high population growht scenarios."

# Introduction
Forests play an important role in maintaining and growing the land-based carbon sink, currently sequestering about 30% of GHG emmissions [@roe2019]. With increasingly negative climate impacts, the pressure to enhance the terrestrial sink is growing, and one of the tools to achieve this is through afforestation. In fact, many of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)  countries have submitted that detail their plans to keep warming under the 2C threshold rely to a significant degree on afforestation projects [@roe2019]. This is because of forests proven ability to sequester carbon in the stems of trees [@davis2022] as well as in their soils [@guo2021]. The gains that can be realized, however, are uncertain, with estimates ranging from 42 gigatonnes [@veldman2019] to 205 gigatonnes [@bastin2019]. At the same time, forests are continually threatened by issues such as rising incomes and food prices and population growth that put pressure on policymakers to allow greater conversion of forestland into farmland. Previous research though has suggested that substantive gains in the carbon sink (+23.8PgCo2e/yr) can be made without sacrificing agricultural land [@griscom2017].

In addition, afforestation appears to not provide the same benefits in all regions of the world. In particular, boreal forests appear to provide the smallest net benefits, as the carbon sequestrations benefits of conifer forests are mitigated by the reduction in albedo in winter [@mykleby2017] [@li2015]. That contrasts with the results for tropical forests where forests there provide a cooling impact due to changes in both albedo and evapotranspiration [@li2015]. Thus, the manner in which these various and oftentimes competing concerns are addressed will have significant impacts on the global community. 

There is growing attention being placed globally to reforestation efforts, which is highligted by the UN's declaration of the years from 2021 through 2030 as the UN Decade of Ecosystem Resotration [@sewell2020].

This project contributes to the literature by melding together two widely accepted global models, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) computable general equilibrium model and the Global Timber Model (GTM), to better assess the outcomes of several likely scenarios. 

Scenarios
1) Full attainment of UN strategic plan for forests 2030 (UNFF):  This says that all deforestation will halt and there will be a 3% (120 million hectare) increase in forest area worldwide by 2030 [@sewell2020].
2) Full attainment of AFR100:  This says that there will be a 100 million hectare increase in forest area just in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 [@sewell2020].
3) Full attainment of goals of Bonn Challenge and New York Declaration on Forests:  This says that all deforestation will halt and there will be a 350 million hectare increase in forest area worldwide by 2030 [@sewell2020].
