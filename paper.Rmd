abstract: "The projected growth of the population and incomes as implied by various shared socioeconomic pathways is expected to create  pressures on converting forests into farmland as food prices increase. Depending on the specific path taken, SSP1 through SSP5, and the continuation of the current trends in agricultural productivity growth, the market impacts are expected to vary but generally resulting in increases in food prices. Policies aimed at reversing the deforestation trend by afforesting crop land would result in severe negative market impacts such as  higher food prices, especially in low agriculutrla productivity/high population growht scenarios."

# Introduction
Forests play an important role in maintaining and growing the land-based carbon sink, and with increasingly negative climate impacts, the pressure to enact afforestation policies is increasing. The potential gain from afforestation projects, however, is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 42 gigatonnes [@veldman19] to 205 gigatonnes [@bastin19]. At the same time, forests are continually threatened by issues such as population growth, rising incomes, and rising food prices that put pressure on policymakers to allow greater conversion on forestland into farmland. The manner is which these various concerns are addressed is certain to have significant impacts on the global community. 

This project contributes to the literature by melding together two widely accepted global models, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) computable general equilibrium model and the Global Timber Model (GTM), to better assess the outcomes of several likely scenarios.
